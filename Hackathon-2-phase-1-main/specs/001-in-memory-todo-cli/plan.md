# Implementation Plan: In-Memory CLI Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-in-memory-todo-cli` | **Date**: 2025-12-31 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Build a command-line Todo application in Python that stores all data in memory. The application provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) plus completion marking through an interactive CLI menu system.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: None (standard library only)
**Storage**: In-memory only (Python list/dict structures)
**Testing**: Manual testing via CLI interaction
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
**Project Type**: Single Python application
**Performance Goals**: <1 second response for 1000 items
**Constraints**: No file I/O, no databases, no networking, no external libraries
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, single-session, transient data

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ **Code Quality & Maintainability**: PEP-8 compliance, single-responsibility functions, clear structure
- ✅ **In-Memory Runtime Constraint**: All data in memory, no persistence mechanisms
- ✅ **Command-Line User Experience**: Menu-driven CLI, clear output, graceful error handling
- ✅ **Architectural Separation**: Separate layers for CLI, business logic, and data models
- ✅ **Transparency & Reviewability**: All artifacts (spec, plan, tasks) documented
- ✅ **Technology Compliance**: Python 3.13+, UV for environment management

    └── todo_cli.py      # CLI interface and menu system

main.py                  # Application entry point

tests/                   # Manual testing scenarios (optional)
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected because this is a standalone CLI application with no web/mobile components. Simple three-layer architecture (models, services, CLI) follows architectural separation principle.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations - application design follows all principles:
- Single project (within limits)
- No external dependencies (standard library only)
- Clear separation of concerns (models/services/CLI)
- In-memory only (no persistence layer)
